# hitters-regression-analysis

This is a report-style linear regression analysis on the Hitters dataset from R's ISLR package.

This report includes a full exploratory analysis of the data and uses regression analysis to transform and create a regression model to accurately fit the data.

This project is the final project from Binghamton University's MATH329.
